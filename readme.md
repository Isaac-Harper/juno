# Juno
This is my personal keymap for my hand soldered Kyria keyboard. I named the software after my roomates cat who appears on the oled screen.
## README NOT UP TO DATE
 




The four different main layers are the following:
1. Base layer 
2. QWERTY Layer
3. SYM layer
4. Game layers

## Base layer
```
Base Layer: -

                       `----------------------------------'  `----------------------------------'
```
I prefer setting my outer modifier keys to keys I need often and on each layer. These keys do not get rewritten on the QWERTY or SYM layers


## QWERTY Layer
```
QWERTY Layer: QWERTY, typing

,-------------------------------------------.                              ,-------------------------------------------.
|        |   Q  |   W  |   E  |   R  |   T  |                              |   Y  |   U  |   I  |   O  |   P  |        |
|--------+------+------+------+------+------|                              |------+------+------+------+------+--------|
|        |   A  |   S  |   D  |   F  |   G  |                              |   H  |   J  |   K  |   L  | ;  : |  "  '  |
|--------+------+------+------+------+------+-------------.  ,-------------+------+------+------+------+------+--------|
|        |   Z  |   X  |   C  |   V  |   B  |      |      |  |      |      |   N  |   M  | ,  < | . >  | /  ? |        |
`----------------------+------+------+------+      +------|  |------+      +------+------+------+----------------------'
                       |      |      |      |      |      |  |      |      |      |      |      |
                       |      |      |      |      |      |  |      |      |      |      |      |
                       `----------------------------------'  `----------------------------------'
```

Aside from variations in the alpha cluster, the rest of the base keys remain the same and are designed to feel familiar.




## Sym layer
```
Sym Layer: Numbers, symbols
                                                                                                                         
,-------------------------------------------.                              ,-------------------------------------------.
|        |  {   |   [  |  (   |   <  |      |                              |  ` ~ |  7 & |  8 * |  9 ( |  0 ) |        |
|--------+------+------+------+------+------|                              |------+------+------+------+------+--------|

|--------+------+------+------+------+------+-------------.  ,-------------+------+------+------+------+------+--------|
|        |  }   |   ]  |  )   |   >  |      |      |      |  |      |      |  = + |  1 ! |  2 @ |  3 # |      |        |
`----------------------+------+------+------+      +------|  |------+      +------+------+------+----------------------'
                       |      |      |      |      |      |  |      |      |      |      |      |
                       |      |      |      |      |      |  |      |      |      |      |      |
                       `----------------------------------'  `----------------------------------'
```

On the left is access to all the brackets possible above and below the home row and on the home row there are the arrow keys. I prefer to navigate with my left hand with the middle finger on the up key, this comes straight from years of video games reinforcing the muscle memory.

On the right is the number pad with shifted characters and a few more symbols to round things out.

This setup gives me access to everything I use regularly though I am still annoyed with the shift position to reach when needing to type many shifted characters quickly, I touch on this more in a later section.


## Hardware Features

### Rotary Encoder
The left rotary encoder is programmed to control the volume.

The right encoder sends <kbd>PgUp</kbd> or <kbd>PgDn</kbd> on every turn.

### OLEDs
The OLEDs display the current layer at the top of the active layers stack, lock status (caps lock, num lock, scroll lock), current words per minute, and a cute Juno animation

### Underglow
The underglow LEDs should be red.

## Complaints
While I am honestly over the moon with this keyboard and use it as my primary keyboard nearly every day there is of course a few things that still annoy me a great deal.
- The outer column is not very accessible as my pinkies don't like to bend outwards. This is especially the case with the shift keys and makes me want to but them in the thumb cluster but the thumbs are already so busy while typing.
- The encoders are also not in a natural place for the hands to rest. I didn't like any of the options of where to put the encoders but would have liked them in the thumb cluster inwards most key second row. These keys are hard to press so I'm not using them right now.
